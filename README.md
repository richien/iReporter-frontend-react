Frontend implementation of the iReporter API using React-Redux

With Corruption high in Africa and a big impedement to its development, African countries must develop novel and localised solutions that will curb this menace, hence the birth of iReporter.
Conceived as part of the developer challenges for joining the Andela Fellowship, iReporter enables any/every citizen to bring any form of corruption to the notice of appropriate authorities and the general public. Users can also report on things that need government intervention.
